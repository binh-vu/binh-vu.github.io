  abstract   = {Major societal and environmental challenges involve complex systems that have diverse multi-scale interacting processes. Consider, for example, how droughts and water reserves affect crop production and how agriculture and industrial needs affect water quality and availability. Preventive measures, such as delaying planting dates and adopting new agricultural practices in response to changing weather patterns, can reduce the damage caused by natural processes. Understanding how these natural and human processes affect one another allows forecasting the effects of undesirable situations and study interventions to take preventive measures. For many of these processes, there are expert models that incorporate state-of-the-art theories and knowledge to quantify a system's response to a diversity of conditions. A major challenge for efficient modeling is the diversity of modeling approaches across disciplines and the wide variety of data sources available only in formats that require complex conversions. Using expert models for particular problems requires integration of models with third-party data as well as integration of models across disciplines. Modelers face significant heterogeneity that requires resolving semantic, spatiotemporal, and execution mismatches, which are largely done by hand today and may take more than 2 years of effort.We are developing a modeling framework that uses artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to reduce modeling effort while ensuring utility for decision making. Our work to date makes several innovative contributions: (1) an intelligent user interface that guides analysts to frame their modeling problem and assists them by suggesting relevant choices and automating steps along the way; (2) semantic metadata for models, including their modeling variables and constraints, that ensures model relevance and proper use for a given decision-making problem; and (3) semantic representations of datasets in terms of modeling variables that enable automated data selection and data transformations. This framework is implemented in the MINT (Model INTegration) framework, and currently includes data and models to analyze the interactions between natural and human systems involving climate, water availability, agricultural production, and markets. Our work to date demonstrates the utility of AI techniques to accelerate modeling to support decision-making and uncovers several challenging directions for future work.},

  abstract  = {Locating undiscovered deposits of critical minerals requires accurate geological data. However, most of the 100,000 historical geological maps of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) are in raster format. This hinders critical mineral assessment. We target the problem of extracting geological features represented as polygons from raster maps. We exploit the polygon metadata that provides information on the geological features, such as the map keys indicating how the polygon features are represented, to extract the features. We present a metadata-driven machine-learning approach that encodes the raster map and map key into a series of bitmaps and uses a convolutional model to learn to recognize the polygon features. We evaluated our approach on USGS geological maps; our approach achieves a median F1 score of 0.809 and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.52\%.},

  abstract  = {With the rapid development of electric vehicles that facilitate sustainable transportation, the need to ensure their accessibility has increased. Determining the optimal locations for extending an existing charging station network is crucial to addressing rising infrastructure needs and reducing environmental impacts. The 13th ACM SIGSPATIAL Cup competition (GISCUP 2024) targets the problem of optimal minimum charging station deployment within an existing network. The recommendation of station locations aims to maximize accessibility over long-distance travel and ensure both coverage and proximity to points of interest or areas with high vehicle usage, while minimizing traffic congestion and reducing impacts on the power grid and the existing charging network. We leverage the categorical Voronoi diagram with hierarchical reconciliation to recommend stations that dovetail with the existing charging network under zero access to historical data. Our approach maximizes station deployment in high-demand areas with equitable distribution. Meanwhile, it complements the existing network to minimize unfavorable impacts on the power grid. Qualitative evaluation on a large-scale real-world dataset shows that our approach effectively balances objectives across areas with diverse geographical and demographic characteristics. In addition, our approach ranked in the top five among all participants in the GISCUP 2024.},
