  descriptions:
    - Reading public datasets are a laborious task and frequently required to write custom code because they are often stored in many different formats (CSV, JSON, Spreadsheet, NetCDF, etc) with different layouts (row-based, matrix, hierarchy).
    - To address the problem, we create a language to represent heterogeneous datasets and very efficient engine to read these datasets from their own formats to a common representation.
