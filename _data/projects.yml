- name: Dataset Representation Language for Reading Heterogeneous Datasets
  image: /assets/homepage/projects/drepr-kcap19.png
  descriptions:
    - Reading public datasets is a laborious task and frequently requires to write custom code because data are often stored in many different formats (CSV, JSON, Spreadsheet, NetCDF, etc) with different layouts (row-based, matrix, hierarchy).
    - To address the problem, we create D-REPR, a language to represent heterogeneous datasets, and a very efficient D-REPR processor to read the datasets from their own formats to a common representation.

- name: Learning Semantic Models of Data Sources Using Probabilistic Graphical Models

  descriptions:
    - The problem is to automatically build semantic descriptions of data for publishing structured sources to knowledge graphs.
    - We use beam search to generate possible candidate semantic models and a probabilistic graphical model as a scoring function to guide the search.
